**Project Proposal: Parallel and Distributed Learning for Ocean and Wind Current Prediction**

## 1. Introduction  
Accurate ocean and wind current prediction is essential for climate modeling, maritime navigation, and disaster prevention. Traditional numerical simulations are computationally expensive, requiring extensive high-performance computing (HPC) resources. In contrast, machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated promising results in capturing complex spatio-temporal patterns with significantly lower computational cost. However, large-scale ocean current modeling remains challenging due to high data dimensionality and real-time processing demands. This project aims to explore, implement, and compare three state-of-the-art ML approaches for ocean and wind current prediction: **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Transformer-Based Spatio-Temporal Models**. Additionally, we will analyze the performance trade-offs between their standard (single-node) implementations and parallel/distributed training approaches.

## 2. Problem Statement  
The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can efficiently predict ocean and wind currents from satellite and observational data. We will focus on comparing different ML techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability. Specifically, we will examine the performance improvements achieved through distributed training on multi-GPU and HPC environments.

## 3. Approaches  

### 3.1 Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)  
- **Description**: PINNs integrate physical equations (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations) into deep learning models to enhance generalization and interpretability.  
- **Advantages**: Ensure physical consistency and generalization to unseen conditions.  
- **Challenges**: Computationally expensive; require specialized solvers.  
- **Parallelization Strategy**: Domain decomposition and multi-GPU training using MPI-based parallelism.  

### 3.2 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Spatio-Temporal Ocean Modeling  
- **Description**: GNNs model spatial dependencies in ocean currents as a graph, capturing relationships between different geographical regions over time.  
- **Advantages**: Efficient at learning spatial-temporal dependencies with fewer parameters than traditional CNNs.  
- **Challenges**: Graph structure introduces memory constraints; requires efficient sampling strategies.  
- **Parallelization Strategy**: Graph partitioning, mini-batch training, and pipeline parallelism across GPUs.  

### 3.3 Transformer-Based Spatio-Temporal Models (Fourier-Based Transformers)  
- **Description**: Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms and Fourier transforms to capture long-range dependencies in spatio-temporal data.  
- **Advantages**: Highly scalable; capable of modeling long-term dependencies effectively.  
- **Challenges**: Computationally expensive due to quadratic complexity of self-attention.  
- **Parallelization Strategy**: Tensor parallelism, mixture-of-experts models, and distributed data parallelism.  

## 4. Evaluation Metrics  
To systematically compare these approaches, we will use the following metrics:  
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients.  
- **Computational Efficiency**: Training time, memory usage, and inference speed.  
- **Scalability**: Speedup achieved with multi-GPU and distributed training compared to baseline single-GPU implementations.  

## 5. Implementation Plan  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Acquire ocean current datasets from NASA ECCO, NOAA, and other publicly available sources.  
2. **Baseline Model Implementations**: Develop single-node implementations for PINNs, GNNs, and Fourier-based Transformers.  
3. **Parallelization Strategies**: Implement multi-GPU and distributed training strategies for each approach.  
4. **Benchmarking & Analysis**: Compare standard vs. distributed training results across all models.  
5. **Final Report & Conclusions**: Summarize findings and recommend optimal approaches based on accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs.  

## 6. Expected Contributions  
- A comparative study of three ML-based ocean/wind current prediction models.  
- Performance benchmarking of single-node vs. distributed training for each approach.  
- Insights into the scalability of physics-informed, graph-based, and transformer-based models for large-scale geospatial applications.   

This project will provide a structured comparison of advanced ML techniques for ocean and wind current prediction while demonstrating the impact of parallel and distributed training strategies on large-scale geophysical data modeling.
